This is a discrete event simulation playground based on the Monks et al (2022), which is itself an implementation of the Treatment Centre Model from Nelson (2013).

By working through the pages on the left in order, you will 
- see how a discrete event simulation builds from simple beginnings up to the point of being able to model a complex system
- understand the impact of variability and randomness on systems

The treatment centre we want to build a model of looks like this:
