When a patient arrives, the computer will pick a random number from this distribution to decide how long it will be before the next patient arrives at our treatment centre. 


Where the line is very high, there is a high chance that the random number picked will be somewhere around that value. 

Where the line is very low, it's very unlikely that the number picked will be from around that area - but it's not impossible. 


This is quite realistic for a lot of systems - people tend to arrive fairly regularly, but sometimes the gap will be longer. 

To start with, we're just going to assume people arrive at a consistent rate throughout all 24 hours of the day. This isn't very realistic, but we can refine this later.
