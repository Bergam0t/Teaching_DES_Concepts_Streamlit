For now, we'll assume all of our patients are roughly equally injured - but there might still be some variation in how long it takes to treat them. Some might need a few stitches, some might just need a quick bit of advice. 

This time, we're going to sample from a different distribution - the normal distribution. A few people won't take very long to fix up, while a few might take quite a long time - but most of the people will take an amount of time that's somewhere in the middle. 

[ADD EXAMPLE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION]

We're going to start measuring a few more things now
- how much of each resource's time is spent with patients **(known as resource utilisation)**
- how long each patient waits before they get allocated a resource
- what percentage of patients meet a target of being treated within 2 hours of turning up to our treatment centre
