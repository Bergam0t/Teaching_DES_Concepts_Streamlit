### Things to Try Out

- What happens when you change the average length of time it takes each patient to be seen?

- What happens when you play around with the number of nurses we have available? 
    - Look at the queues, but look at the resource utilisation too. The resource utilisation tells us how much of the time each nurse is busy rather than waiting for a patient to turn up. 
    - Can you find a middle ground where the nurse is being used a good amount without the queues building up?

- What happens if we add in a fixed amount of time for paperwork after each patient? 

- What happens if some of our nurses go off shift overnight?
